You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /home/piyush/classroom

[info] 
=== Project Setup

[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.

[info] will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
[info] have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
